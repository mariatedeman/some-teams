        <p>It’s time for the big question, Hans. What team is actually the best in Sweden? Although Hammarby is putting up a good fight, I’m sure this season will end in black and yellow.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I’m a football crazy, cheese loving girl from Gothenburg.
                Football in general, women's football in particular. Football has been a part
                of my life for as long as I can remember, both as a player and a spectator.
                Cheese, even longer, and if I would have had it my way as a four year old I
                would have gorgonzola on my sandwich at day care. They didn't have gorgonzola.
                If I had to choose between football and cheese, I would die. Or choose chocolate. </p>
